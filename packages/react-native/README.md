# ElevenAgents React Native SDK

Build multimodal agents with [ElevenAgents](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/eleven-agents/overview) in React Native.

This package is a React Native companion to [`@elevenlabs/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@elevenlabs/react). It re-exports the full conversation API and automatically configures the platform for voice conversations on React Native (WebRTC polyfills and native AudioSession setup).

## Installation

```shell
npm install @elevenlabs/react-native @livekit/react-native @livekit/react-native-webrtc
```

The LiveKit peer dependencies provide the native WebRTC modules required for voice conversations in React Native.

> **Note:** This SDK requires Expo development builds. Expo Go is not supported due to native module requirements.

## Quick Start

```tsx
import {
  ConversationProvider,
  useConversationControls,
  useConversationStatus,
} from "@elevenlabs/react-native";

function App() {
  return (
    {/* replace with your agent's ID */}
    <ConversationProvider agentId="agent_7101k5zvyjhmfg983brhmhkd98n6">
      <Conversation />
    </ConversationProvider>
  );
}

function Conversation() {
  const { startSession, endSession } = useConversationControls();
  const { status } = useConversationStatus();

  return (
    <>
      <Text>Status: {status}</Text>
      <Button
        title="Start"
        onPress={() =>
          startSession({
            onConnect: ({ conversationId }) =>
              console.log("Connected:", conversationId),
            onError: (message) => console.error("Error:", message),
          })
        }
      />
      <Button title="End" onPress={() => endSession()} />
    </>
  );
}
```
